****FdToSql****


It is a Script for converting FD Files to SQL Queries and UML Diagram. It works really well for the Unstructured FD files (encoding can be UFT-8, UFT-32 or any other format) and converts it to CSV and SQL format. With SQL formatted data you can easily create the structured database.

Here we used the FD Files from an Ingres Database and restored it.
