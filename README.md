# FdToSql


It is a Script for converting FD Files to SQL Queries and UML Diagram. It works really well for the Unstructured FD files (encoding can be UFT-8, UFT-32 or any other format) and converts it to CSV and SQL format. With SQL formatted data you can easily create the structured database.

Here we used the FD Files from an Ingres Database and restored it.

## Instruction How to use

Just run the main.py file!

First Input:
'Can you please give the path of the files?'
You can provide the path for the FD files.

Second Input:

After providing the file name it will create the SQL file for generating tables and also inserting all the data into it.
